Besides a player's mental strength—the ability to adjust to situations and solve problems—the athlete's level of conditioning plays a great role in helping him to reach their peak performance regularly. Conditioning is the sum of all physical factors affecting performance. Conditioning can be broken down to the various elements such as: endurancespeedpowermobilitycoordination The better trained each element is, the closer the athlete will get to optimum performance. One of the contributing factors for improving performance is motor fitness—agility, power, quickness, and speed.","keywords":""},{"title":"Agility Drills","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"docs/motor-fitness-training/agility-drills","content":"Basic Agility 1 Purpose: To build reaction time, change direction, explosiveness in the hips, abdominals, lower back, quadriceps, hamstrings. ![Basic Agility 1 (old)](../.gitbook/assets/image (33).png) Procedure: Use one-and-a-half court sStart at WAt the coach’s signal sprint out fast toward XRotate hip and make sure that one foot crosses XSprint as fast as possible toward Y, rotate hips and make sure that one foot crosses YSprint toward Z and run through Basic Agility 2 Purpose: To build reaction time, change direction, explosiveness in the hips, abdominals, lower back, quadriceps, hamstrings. ![Basic Agility 2 (old)](../.gitbook/assets/image (13).png) Use one-and-a-half courtsStart at AAt the coach’s signal sprint cut as fast toward B, C, D, E, F, **and finish at G**Sprint towards G and run through","keywords":""},{"title":"Conclusion","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"docs/motor-fitness-training/conclusion","content":"Conclusion The exercises suggested in this booklet need to be modified according to needs.

Therefore it is anaerobic based.The movements are lateral and vertical. Strengthening the lower body is vital, especially the ankles, knees and hips. All three extensions must produce explosive movements.Badminton movement consists of a lot of hip flips. This means a lot of work must be done on the core-abdomen and lower back.Agility is conducting dynamic movement in small area. Quickness is reaction time and explosive speed.Explosiveness is essential especially in defence.Agility and quickness are neuromuscular skills that help increase adaptability, explosive acceleration, deceleration and precision with which players can handle their own bodies facilitating smooth coordination between the body position, footwork, racket control while reacting to constant and rapid changes in playing situation.Being able to combine quickness and agility is most important in badminton.Quickness and agility training consist of quality, not quantity.The best way to improve quickness and agility is through plyometrics.In plyometrics, muscles serve with a memory, memorizing the time it takes for your muscle to lengthen and shorten. The muscle store elastic energy between the two actions and cause explosiveness. By repeating the exercises, the muscles will perfect the action.","keywords":""},{"title":"Style Guide","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"docs/","content":"You can write content using GitHub-flavored Markdown syntax.
